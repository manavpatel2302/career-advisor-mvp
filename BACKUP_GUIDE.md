## 📝 Daily Workflow

### Save Changes Locally
```bash
# Check what changed
git status

# Add all changes
git add -A

# Commit with message
git commit -m "Description of changes"

# Push to GitHub
git push
```

### Quick Save Script
Create `save.bat` for one-click saves:
```batch
@echo off
echo Saving project...
git add -A
git commit -m "Auto-save: %date% %time%"
git push
echo Project saved to GitHub!
pause
```

## 🛡️ Best Practices

### 1. Regular Commits
```bash
# After each feature
git add -A
git commit -m "Add: [feature description]"
git push
```

### 2. Multiple Backup Locations
- ✅ GitHub (primary)
- ✅ Local backup (weekly)
- ✅ Cloud storage (automatic)
- ✅ External drive (monthly)

### 3. Version Tags
```bash
# Tag important versions
git tag -a v1.0 -m "First release"
git push origin v1.0
```

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### "Permission Denied" on Push
```bash
# Set up credentials
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"

# For GitHub, use Personal Access Token
# Go to GitHub Settings → Developer Settings → Personal Access Tokens
```

### Large Files Issue
```bash
# If you have files >100MB
git lfs track "*.large"
git add .gitattributes
```

### Undo Last Commit
```bash
# Undo last commit but keep changes
git reset --soft HEAD~1
```
